# gigachad-landing-page

The objective of this project was to create a "landing-page" that would be suitable for both smartphones and conventional web browsers. I have learned a lot through the development of this site. Many ideas that were discarded, themes that didn't convince me enough and I ended up repeating this process several times, until I came up with a page in honor of the symbol that represents the GIGACHAD, almost the physical representation of Nietzsche's superman. I decided to derive a little from the template presented in the "Landing Page" lesson of The Odin Project. I wanted to create a page that would not only satisfy me by making a simple clone of what I was asked for. But I also wanted that what I still don't know if I should call motivation, that catapulted me a burst of energy to not stop on my way. Not only I tried to polish my code in the many pages I made before uploading this one to my repo, but I wanted to improve its look, a classic 3-tone tone derived only from black and white, referring to the colors of the gigachad.
It was certainly gratifying to be able to have the page as I wanted it, I spent a lot of time thinking, and not just copying a model to follow. The tonalities were something that although you can't see at first sight, I spent some time combining them in the phoshop color palette to adjust them to my taste.
